                                We are a team of scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs developing Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible neural electrodes and acquisition system for electrophysiology recording and brain stimulation. Our initial
                                research started out in <a href="https://abilab.mgh.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Analog Brain Imaging Laboratory</a> that paved the way for early stage prototypes to develop and lab bench tested, largely supported with funding from the National Institutes of Health.

                                primate. Mr. Millan brings 30+ years of experience leading projects, designing and engineering Integrated Circuits for various applications in the private sector. Mr. Millan has been part of the engineering and design team in small and mid-size companies where he played a key role in the company's prototype/product development cycle and provided important structure for developing and bringing new products to market. Separate from his experience in the private sector, Mr. Millan has worked with NIH-funded investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital since 2004, where he integrated tightly and demonstrated successful collaboration with the research teams. Mr. Millan received his Bachelor of
                                Science in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts in 1978.
